title: About
---

I work at Simple Machines Sydney.
I am author of zio-config, and working on a few other open source projects these days as well.
I mostly work on Scala, Java, Python and Go languages. I have experience in data engineering, big data, streaming, achine learning and web applications.
I know (and still learning) Haskell and that's my favourite language and that's how I improve programming with any other language. That said, I am loving rust and Idris as well.
I always try and help people write functional programming (while I am still learning a lot about it recently).
