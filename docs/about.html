        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I work at Simple Machines Sydney. I am author of zio-config, and working on a few other open source projects these days as well. I mostly work on Scala, Java, Python and Go languages. I have experience in data engineering, big data, streaming, machine learning and web applications. I know (and still learning) Haskell and that’s my favourite language and that’s how I improve programming with any other language. That said, I am loving rust and Idris as well. I always try and help people write functional programming (while I am still learning a lot about it recently).</p>
